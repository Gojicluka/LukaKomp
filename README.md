# LukaKomp
Project done back in 2021

Graduation project that consists of a site, database and a c# application. Application is an admin panel where you can add new components, check the salles, make a new pc configuration (which has all the compatible components), or add an entirely new category of products. On the site you can buy the components individually or you can buy a configuration that an admin made.
